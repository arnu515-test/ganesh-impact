# Ganesh Impact

Random Discord RPC app I created to piss off Genshin fans.

## How to run

1. Download the latest release for your operating system.

2. Open the directory you downloaded it to and open that directory in the terminal. This can be done by typing `cmd` in windows explorer, or pressing Right Click and Open in Terminal on Mac/Linux

3. Run the executable by typing `./filename` on Mac/Linux and `filename.exe` on Windows.
